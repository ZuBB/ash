[USB Oscilloscope application](http://injectorservice.com.ua/) has ability to run scripts written in JavaScript.

Development of large script assumes appearance large amount of repetitive code snippets.

To help developer avoid boring copy/pastes I have created micro-framework called ash (**a**utoscope **s**cript **h**elper).

It solves all low-level tasks itself still providing convinent API to developer to manage that process.
